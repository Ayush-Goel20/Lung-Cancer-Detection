# Enhanced Lung Cancer Detection Using MobileNet, EfficientNet, and GANs
This project aims to improve the accuracy of lung cancer detection from CT scan images using a deep learning framework that combines MobileNet, EfficientNet, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The use of GANs for synthetic image generation enhances model generalization and reduces overfitting.

# 📌 Features
> Detects malignant vs. benign lung cancer from CT images
>Utilizes lightweight and powerful CNN architectures
>Enhances training with synthetic data generated by GANs
>Improves sensitivity and specificity for better medical insights 
>Visualizes model performance with graphs and metrics
