Enhanced Lung Cancer Detection Using MobileNet, EfficientNet, and GANs
This project aims to improve the accuracy of lung cancer detection from CT scan images using a deep learning framework that combines MobileNet, EfficientNet, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The use of GANs for synthetic image generation enhances model generalization and reduces overfitting.

📌 Features
Detects malignant vs. benign lung cancer from CT images

Utilizes lightweight and powerful CNN architectures

Enhances training with synthetic data generated by GANs

Improves sensitivity and specificity for better medical insights

Visualizes model performance with graphs and metrics

📊 Dataset
CT Scan Images: Preprocessed lung CT scans (public datasets such as LIDC-IDRI)

Synthetic Images: Generated using GANs to expand training data
